# Hospital Emergency Room Visits Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using Power BI)
## Project Objective
The objective of this Hospital Emergency Room Visits Dashboard project is to provide real-time insights into patient visits, average wait times, satisfaction scores, and admission status (admitted vs. non-admitted). The dashboard aims to help healthcare administrators and staff make data-driven decisions to improve patient care, optimize resource allocation, and enhance operational efficiency within the emergency room setting. By analysing trends over time, the dashboard supports continuous performance monitoring and improvements.
